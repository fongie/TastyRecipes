I chose to run all commands for comments through recipesite to reduce coupling on the controller
Some commands just get run through, but it also helps not making RecipeSite a HUGE class that does everything

I already had a functioning MVC model without using namespaces and autoloading since the program was so small


I implemented file security (see images)
